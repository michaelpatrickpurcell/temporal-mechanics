# Game Play

## Act 1
In this act, the characters recall a significant event from their past that they want to change. They will then formulate a plan to alter the outcome of that event.  The players will construct a scene that will be the climax of the game's story. The players will then construct an interconnected set of scenes that lead to that climax.

### Flashback
One way to set the tone for the game early on is to play through the events of the climactic event as remembered by the characters. This gives the players a chance to make suggestions about the story and get a feel for the sorts of backstory scenes might be appropriate and interesting to explore in Act 2.

### Backstory

## Act 2
In Act 2, the characters travel back in time to carry out the plan to change the past.

### Scenes
Each scene is subdivided into three phases.
   1. __Investigate:__ In this phase, the characters explore the scene's setting. The players identify/assign aspects to the people/places/things that their characters encounter during this phase.
   2. __Influence:__ In this phase, the characters attempt to influence the outcome of the encounter. The players assemble a dice pool, roll the dice, and compare the result of the roll to the encounter's difficulty rating.
   3. __Interpret:__ In this phase, the characters find out what happened as a result of their actions. The players describe the narrative consequences of the outcome of the encounter's influence roll.

## Act 3
In Act 3, the characters travel back to the future and discover the consequences of their meddling with the timeline.
