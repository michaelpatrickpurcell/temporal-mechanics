# Temporal Mechanics

When things go awry with someone's car, they call their mechanic.  
When things go awry with the timeline, they call you!

## Structure
Each adventure takes place in two phases.

The first phase is set in the future.
In this phase the characters are preparing a message to send back to their former selves.
This message describes a series of events that occured during a job that they did many years ago.

The second phase is set in the present.
In this phase, the characters receive the message sent by their future selves.
Their job is to ensure that the events described in the message occur.

## Technobabble
Characters send messages from the future back to their past selves using a _Tachyonic Antitelephone_. 
These devices are rare, expensive, and incredibly energy hungry.
A tachyonic antitelephone can only be used to send messages to a past version of itself.
As such, no messages can be sent to a time before the first tachyonic antitelephone was created.
Furthermore, any such messages are necessarily short.
Most systems limit messages to no more than 256 characters.
