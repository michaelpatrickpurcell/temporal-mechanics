# Temporal Mechanics

When things go awry with someone's car, they call their mechanic.  
When things go awry with the timeline, they call you!

## Technobabble
Any good work of science fiction needs a modicum of technobabble to grease the narrative wheels a bit and facilitate the suspension of disbelief required by the genre.
   1. __Tachyonic Antitelephone:__
   Characters send messages from the future back to their past selves using a _Tachyonic Antitelephone_.
   A tachyonic antitelephone can only be used to send messages to a past version of itself.
   As such, no messages can be sent to a time before the first tachyonic antitelephone was created.
   These devices are rare, expensive, and incredibly energy hungry.
   Therefore, any messages sent by an tachyonic antitelephone are necessarily short.

   2. __Temporal Inertia:__
   The timeline is robust.
   Altering the course of history is difficult and fraught with peril.
   The more significant an event is the more difficult it is to affect and the more serious the consequences for failure.
   This property is known as _temporal inertia_.

## Characters
There are two kinds of characters.
   1. __Player Characters (PCs):__ The PCs are the heroes of the story.
   Each PC is controlled by a single player throughout the game.

   2. __Non-Player Characters (NPCs):__ The NPCs are everybody else.
   NPCs can be controlled by any of the players as the need arises during the game.

## Traits
Characters are described by a set of _traits_.
A trait is simply an aspect that is assigned to a player character.
Five traits are assigned to each PC during character creation.
Each character should be assigned one trait from each of the following categories:
   - __Occupation:__ An aspect that describes a character's profession, hobbies, or other interests.
   This aspect should be how the character answers the question "What do you do?"
   - __Physical or Mental Characteristic:__ An aspect that describes a character's body and mind.
   Are they a genius?
   Are they clumsy?
   Are they particularly strong?
   This aspect is a chance to capture that kind of detail.
   - __Psychological Characteristic:__ An aspect that describes a character's personality.
   These characteristics could be beneficial or detrimental; the best are a little bit of both.
   - __Relationship:__ An aspect that describes a character's connection with another character.
   If the other character is an NPC, then they should feature prominently in the game's story.
   If the other character is a PC, then the game's story should test the relationship somehow.
   - __Affiliation:__ An aspect that describes a character's connection with an organisation.
   Such an organisation should be a prominent feature of the game's story.
   Affiliations provide a nice way to paint the game's setting with broad strokes and really leverage the power of genre tropes to full advantage.

## Acts
Each adventure is subdivided into three acts:
   1. __Setup:__
      The first act is set in the future.
      In this act the characters prepare a message to send back to their former selves.
      This message describes a series of events that occurred many years ago.

   2. __Confrontation:__
      The second act is set in the present.
      In this act, the characters receive the message sent by their future selves.
      Their job is to ensure that the events described in the message occur.

   3. __Resolution:__
      The third act is again set in the future.
      In this act, the characters learn the consequences of their meddling with the timeline.

## Scenes
Each scene is subdivided into three phases:
   1. __Investigate:__ In this phase, the characters explore the scene.
   The players identify/assign aspects to the people/places/things that their characters encounter during this phase.

   2. __Influence:__ In this phase, the characters attempt to alter the timeline.
   The players make a check to determine the outcome of the scene.

   3. __Interpret:__ In this phase, the characters find out what happened as a result of their actions.
   The players describe the narrative consequences of the outcome of the encounter's influence roll.

## Time Limits
   - Act 2 consists off no more than eight scenes.
   - Each scene is played out in ten minutes of real time.

## Story Tree
The players describe a sequence of significant events by creating a _story tree_.
   - Story trees have a maximum depth of three.
   - Each scene can have at most three child encounters.

## Depth
The climactic scene always has a depth of _d = 0_.
The depth of other scenes is the number of edges between that scene and the climactic scene.

#### Example
Add an example!

## Checks
A _check_ is used to determine the outcome of a scene.
To make a check, the players will:
   1. __Compute the check's difficulty rating:__
   The difficulty rating of a check depends on the depth of the scene.
   The difficulty rating of an scene with depth _d_ is _4 - d_.
   2. __Assemble a dice pool:__
   A dice pool is made up of one or more six-sided dice (d6s).
   The number of dice in the dice pool depends on both the characters involved, those characters' actions, and the environment.
   3. __Roll the dice:__
   The dice in the dice pool are _exploding dice_.
   That is, for every die that yields a value of `6` one additional die is added to the dice pool and rolled.
   The values of all the rolls contribute to the result of the check.
   4. __Determine the result of the roll:__
   Any die that yields a value of `1`, `2`, or `3` is a _miss_.
   Any die that yields a value of `4`, `5`, or `6` is a _hit_.
   The result of a roll is the total number of hits.
   5. __Compare the result of the roll to the check's difficulty rating:__
   If the result of the players' roll exceeds or meets the check's difficulty, then they _succeed_ at the check and their characters accomplish their goal.
   Otherwise, the players _fail_ at the check and their characters do not accomplish their goal.

#### Example
   Suppose the players are making a check to determine the outcome of a scene that has a depth of _d = 1_.
   The difficulty rating of the scene is _3_.
   Suppose further that the dice pool contains five dice.
   When rolled, these dice yield the values {`3`, `6`, `5`, `1`, `6`}.
   Because two of the dice yielded a value of `6`, two additional dice are added to the pool.
   When rolled, these dice yield the values {`2`,`6`}.
   Because one of the dice yielded a value of `6`, one additional die is added to the pool.
   When rolled, this die yields the value {`4`}.
   In total, this roll yields the values {`3`, `6`, `5`, `1`, `6`, `2`, `6`, `4`}.
   The result of this roll would be five hits.
   The number of hits exceeds the difficulty rating so the players would succeed at the check.

### Assemble a Dice Pool
A dice pool is made up of one or more six-sided dice (d6s).
The number of dice in the dice pool depends on both the characters involved, those characters' actions, and the environment.

Characters and environments both have _aspects_.
Character aspects are generally created before the encounter begins and describe who the characters are and what they can do.
Environment aspects are generally created during an encounter and describe the people, places, and things that the characters interact with during that encounter.

At the end of each scene, make two lists.
One list consists of all of the _character aspects_.
The other list consists of the _environment aspects_ relevant to the scene.
Add one die to the dice pool for each relevant environment aspect that _matches_ a character aspect.
Two aspects are considered a match if the characters could use the interplay between them to manipulate the encounter to their advantage.

#### Example
Suppose an NPC who needs to be prevented from catching a flight has the aspect "Argumentative".
In this case, "Argumentative" itself might be the best match that could appear in the characters' aspect list.
The NPC could be drawn into an argument with the PCs or even provoked into doing something that would get them kicked off of the flight.

If instead the NPC had the the aspect "Meek", then character aspects like "Aggressive", "Demanding", or even "Angry" might be appropriate matches.
The NPC could be simply intimidated by the PCs and coerced into doing what the PCs want them to do.
